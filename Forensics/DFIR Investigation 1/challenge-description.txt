Our company's machine has been compromised, and initial investigations suggest that the attacker gained a foothold through brute-forcing RDP credentials. To gather crucial information from the Windows Event Logs, we need to extract the attacker's IP address, successful logon date, number of failed attempts. note that in the logontime for exemple 4:23:57 PM should be 16:23:57

Flag Format : DEFENSYS{attackerIP_HH:MM:SS_numberOfFailedAttempts} 
Flag Exemple : DEFENSYS{10.0.0.1_16:05:57_19}
